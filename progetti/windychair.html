                <div class="text-block">
                    <p><strong>Windy Chair</strong> has been designed for the contest of the company Riva 1920 in the 2016.
                        It has simple and organic shapes, according to natural materials as solid cherry wood and iron.
                        Choosing two materials so diff erent to each other, it has been created a sharp contrast that
                        could attract the attention emphasizing the chair’s characteristic shape and its natural and fresh
                        aspect. Chair’s elements are connected through a continue and harmonious dialogue developed
                        in the surrounding environment in which the object is placed in a natural and not invasive way.
                        It is a naked object, essential, that with its simplicity fully expressed the value that it is intended to
                        transmit, a value linked with the respect of the nature and with the little everyday actions which,
                        if well and carefully analyzed, can, through accurate projects, improve our everyday life.</p>
