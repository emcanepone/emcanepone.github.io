                    <p><strong>GNAM</strong> logo was born after a reflection about art
                        and modernity. Art is movement because of its
                        currents succession, and it is a very fast process. So
                        we have chosen the circle. The M is emphasized
                        because the modern is something that unhinge
                        the art standards. The type is irregular and there is
                        a dynamic play with thicknesses and spots: they are also in the
                        circle to platonically join the modernity with the art
                        which everyday leave their tracks (the spots) inside all
                        of us. So we decided to put spots around the logo too and in this way they become an
                        important element of the brand identity.</p>
