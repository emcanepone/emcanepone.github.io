                    <p><strong>Sinfonia</strong> is an automatic coff ee machine result from an analyses of the
                        spatiality, potentiality and
                        limits of the contemporary kitchen and the future previsions of its changes. It is born from
                        the
                        necessity to satisfy each tastes in the family trying also to overcome the encumbrance, often
                        irreconcilable in a kitchen that is becoming smaller and smaller. The design is characterized
                        by
                        a duplex spatial confi guration: “open” along a single axis; “close” to create a 90 degrees
                        angle
                        (space saving). The fi l rouge has been the will to recreate the relation between the object
                        and
                        the user experience through three modalities: gestuality (gesture recognition) for turning it
                        ON
                        and OFF and pouring the coffee; manuality (tradition) through a mechanical handle related with
                        the historical coff ee machines; comprehention (parts distinction) obtained using materials of
                        the
                        coff ee tradition and the copper handicraft. Refl ective and opaque, coff ee and water,
                        territoriality and internationality, tradition and innovation: distinct elements that the user,
                        as an orchestra
                        conductor, with a simple gesture, converges to a single symphony: coffee.</p>
