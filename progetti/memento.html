                    <p> <strong>Memento</strong> is a writing desk which tries to embody the traditional and historical
                        value of this object
                        together with an attention to the current society and customers’ demand.

                        The general concept, which is based on the idea of ​​memory and the emotional value of the
                        object in
                        question, focuses on the sensorial and material expression of its parts, which enhance and
                        encourage
                        the use of our five senses highlighting their physical interaction with the surrounding without
                        the
                        aid of advanced technologies but focusing entirely on human experience.
                        The researched solution
                        wants to bring that magical aura which has always surrounded it, back, in a world where man is
                        forgetting to feel and experite with its body and is always looking for emotions and solutions
                        in
                        the virtual and high tech world.

                        The trapezoidal profile translates the very first purpose of the writing desk (writing important
                        manuscripts and documents down) in a structure that creates a personal, safe and emotional
                        space.
                        The shutter is the element which gives Memento several interesting configurations when opened or
                        closed, front-side or back view. The structure is made by oak, a very smelly, strong
                        and touchy wood, meanwhile the interior accessories, divisors and extra-space, designed to
                        improve
                        the customization, can be lacquered or covered with a thin layer of eco-friendly leather, in
                        different
                        colors.<br>

                        <strong>With Memento the memories of the past re-emerge. Its simple and elegant lines represent
                            a timeless icon.</strong></p>
