                    <p><strong>Clap</strong> has been developed during my Erasmus programme in France.
                        We have been asked to produce an object to fit in a small kitchen, meeting the actual necessity
                        to save space because of the increasingly small spaces in which we live.
                        My key words for this project were: dinamicity,
                        praticality, simmetry.
                        I designed a table to be practical, compact and easily removed to save space.
                        Thank to a wooden joint, it can be opened and closed depending on the uses. When closed, it
                        becomes a simple and comfortable shelf to put things on, have a tidier kitchen and optimize the
                        space in the room.
                        It has been made with wood and plexiglass, manually processed to become translucid and reach
                        that particular texture.</p>
