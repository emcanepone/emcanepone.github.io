                    <p><strong>Shareavan</strong> is a mono - caravan tought for 1 or 2 people. Its shape is ispired by a natural. armonious
                        and dynamic element, the wave, together with the idea of sheltering and protecting without
                        losing the contact with the environment as the nowadays caravans do. That is why this caravan
                        has several transparent openings, included the bedroom roof to allow campers having natural
                        light during the day and stargazing during the night.
                        The exterior body is textured in order to improve the strength and the resistance. It is possible
                        to entirely open the caravan and connect it to another module, in order to share a central space.
                        Thanks to transparent plastic layers built under the outside waves, Shareavan can have diff erent
                        confi gurations. Moreover customers have the possibility to choose colors among the ones in the
                        catalogue. This allows to estabilish an identity with the caravan and create an emotional link.</p>
