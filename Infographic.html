                    <p> The entire project was thought to work on the Park of Aqueducts of Rome. Principal goals are
                        the valorization and a more correct fruition of the park.
                        The lack of planimetries of the park and the absence of a description of it and its history,
                        guided me to think to project some info panels for the principal entrance of the area. So
                        the idea to create an interactive panel, to communicate with the user and make him share
                        stimolating his interest and curiosity.
                        This idea was born from an accurate analysis of the users, changed from the past ones, no
                        more interested in reading lots of words about history but with the will to do it if stimolated
                        and
                        made protagonist through the help of the technology and the digital. That is the reason of the
                        creation of two sided panel with interaction systems embodied in it.</p>

                    <p> The current <strong>infopoint</strong> of the park is small, badly kept and only active on
                        sundays. Known
                        the importance of the roman style in the park and understood it is not possible to intervene
                        on it without taking into account the environment and the background, I chose to design a
                        microstructure with a touchscreen display to automate it, a shelf under it to rest, a bench to
                        allow people to sit down and rest, and a drinking fountain.</p>

                    <p> Working with the theme of the aqueduct, it seemed necessary and appropriate to deal with and
                        exalt the theme of the water.
                        For this reason, taking ispiration from the work of the Casa No Tempo of Aires Mateus and Jo√£o
                        and Andreia Rodrigues, I chose to positionate some long basins, as stretches of water, next to
                        the Felice Aqueduct, to indicate and accompany the flow of the water inside it.
                        These basins, put side by side some benches, become a place of rest, meeting, reference
                        point but also for fun.</p>
