                    <p> <strong>Escher</strong> is mostly famous for his so-called impossible constructions, such
                        as Ascending and Descending, Relativity, his Transformation Prints, such as Metamorphosis
                        I, Metamorphosis II and Metamorphosis III, Sky & Water I or Reptiles. But he also made some
                        wonderful, more realistic works during the time he lived and traveled in Italy. To realize this
                        texture
                        I researched about Escherâ€™s drawings to understand better his kind of work.
                        I firstly decided to draw a fish and during my project I found the right joint to draw a rabbit
                        too,
                        avoiding empty spaces and fictions. I used bright colors to emphasize the contrast
                        between the two animals.</p>
