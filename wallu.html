                    <p><strong>Wall-U</strong> is born to create a joint that could be the object itself but also a structural function.
                        First ispiration has been the nature, followed by concept as expandability, modularity,
                        multifunctionality, customization and confi gurations. We decided to use a natural material as
                        the birch wood together with a more “artifi cial” one as the metal, creating an armonious and
                        logical union. Wall-U is an accessoried wall unit that permits an infi nity of possible confi gurations
                        and customization. It is made by an aluminium perfored sheet, to be used alone o joined with
                        others, giving the chance to be functional to both sides and to communicate. The modular joint
                        has diff erent functions: coat hanger, mirror or shelf. Every wall unit will be unique because each
                        customer can create his own.</p>
