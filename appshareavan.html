                    <p><strong>Shareavan App</strong> was born for a
                        consideration: nowdays young
                        people truly loves to communicate
                        with its friends or to know new
                        people through social networks
                        and Apps. It is something that
                        should be included in a project in
                        order to increase the interest of
                        the customers, to improve the user
                        experience as part of the project and
                        to create an identity at an emotional
                        level between user and product/
                        service.
                        That is why the Service App I want
                        to create stays to improve the
                        user experience giving them the
                        opportunity to choose the object
                        features through an easy “click”</p>
