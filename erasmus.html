                    <p>During the time I spent in the Erasmus Office as a winner of the scolarship related with the collaborations of honours students with some 
                        Departments of the University, I could help in developing and improving the identity and the graphics of the Office itself and the great committment of the people
                    working here. I was asked to realize Christmas and Easter brochures and greeting cards, logos for the merchandising and some projects for the Incoming students and so on. 
                It was a great opportunity to try my skills and facing real tasks.</p>
