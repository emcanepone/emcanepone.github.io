                    <p><strong>US</strong> main guideline was the focus on the concept of empathy: the psychological identifi cation
                        with or vicarious experiencing of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of another.
                        After analyzing and researching about it, we developed this product that creates a relation with
                        two worlds, diff erent but in a close contact. Indeed, it is made by two signs, one for the cyclists
                        and one for the drivers. On the border some coloured and intermittent LEDs are added. The two
                        parts are joined through a central alluminium element and on the back there is a box with a solar
                        panel on. The object expresses the need of a strong collaboration on the road and a warning
                        message for the cyclist and the drivers too, because on the road “We all road together”.</p>
