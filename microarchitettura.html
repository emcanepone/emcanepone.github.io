                    <p><strong>Home</strong> was thought to keep a dialog with the Rationalism, integrating it with the modernity. We took
                        ispiration by the Bourellec brothers’ works, especially the diaphram; the “refuge”, a concept
                        that represents the “house” in the collective immagination; our project wants to be a landmark
                        and a meeting point for the students, giving them the possiblity to be informed in a original
                        and interactive way. The labyrinth was ideated to create a space that stimulates the student
                        and amuses him. The fi rst ispiration comes from the labyrinth in the Palace Versailles gardens
                        made by Andrè La Notre with a group of funtains and sculptures to tell the Esopo stories.
                        We decided to place some QR CODE in specifi c corners around the labyrinth to inform the
                        students about several themes. In the centre of this place, a transparent, minimal and squared
                        fountain creates a meeting point to chill out and relax.</p>
