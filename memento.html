                    <p><strong>Memento</strong> is a writing desk which tries to embody the
                        traditional and
                        historic value of this object
                        together with an attention to the current society and customersâ€™ demand. The trapezoidal
                        profile translates the very first purpose of the writing desk (writing important manuscripts
                        and
                        documents down) in a structure that creates a personal, safe and emotional space. The
                        shutter is
                        the element which gives Memento several interesting configurations when opened or closed,
                        front-side or
                        back view. The back of the shutter is made with eco-friendly leather, sustainable,
                        colorfully, soft-touch and light. The structure is made by oak, a very smelly, strong and
                        touchy
                        wood, meanwhile the interior accessories, divisors and extra-space, designed to improve the
                        customization, can be lacquered or covered with a thin layer of eco-friendly leather, in diff
                        erent
                        colors.
                        <strong>With Memento the memories of the past re-emerge. Its simple and elegant lines represent
                            a
                            timeless icon.</strong></p>
