                <div class="text-block">
                    <p><strong>Megan</strong> is born following a process that focused on the smell. Indeed starting from smelling a
                            fragrance, I developed several words and concepts for me connected with that smell; I translated
                            them in images, shapes, textures, colors and then I fi gured them out in a characteristic pefume
                            bottle. I thought about a Disney character of the movie Hercules, Megara. She is “a free-spirited
                            indipendent and quick-witted woman who is hurt and bitter too. She’s braver and stronger that
                            she thinks and a very sensitive girl” Materials, shapes and textures refl ect these features and so
                            do the the ones of her counterpart, Hercules. He is “compassionate and his most dominate trait
                            is, whitout a doubt,.his innocence and massively kind heart, in spite of being trated like a freak”.
                            The two bottles hold together is a passionate and strong hug which show the diff erence between
                            the two personalities but also their match.</p>
