                    <p><strong>Sensecan</strong> is born to help in taking care of the own garden in a easy, fast and interactive way. It
                        has been developed a device that, through coloured LED (blue, red, yellow) and diff erent sensors
                        (light, temperature, humidity sensor), lets the plants necessities visible. Each LED is connected
                        to a function: red for temperature, yellow one for light and blue for humidity. When the LED
                        is blinking it means the plant has absorbed too much humidity, light and/or temperature; if
                        it stays on, the sensorsâ€™ values are at minimum; if it is off , the plant is okay and does not need
                        anything. It has been developed an App to know more details about the plants, the device and
                        the community .The shape metaphorically stays for the watering can, one of the most symbolic
                        and traditional tool for gardening. The materials used were the transparent PMMA for the upper
                        part and coloured translucid plastic strips to let each function be visibile; and alluminium for the
                        lower part and the extreme points of the transparent body.</p>
